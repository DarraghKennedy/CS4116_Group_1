            <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">From Tech Industry Employee to Coding Education Pioneer</h5>
            
            <p>Three years ago, David Chen was a senior developer at a tech company, feeling burnt out from the corporate environment. "I loved solving problems and building things, but I wasn't feeling fulfilled," David recalls. "I had always enjoyed the mentoring aspects of my job, helping junior developers grow."</p>
            
            <p>Looking for a way to combine his technical expertise with his passion for teaching, David discovered EduCoach. "What started as a weekend experiment quickly became my calling," he says. "I created a few programming tutorials that addressed common pain points I had seen in the industry, and the response was immediate."</p>
            
            <p>David's courses on web development, data structures, and algorithms attracted students who appreciated his real-world approach. "Unlike academic courses, I focus on practical skills that employers actually look for. I teach the way I wish I had been taught when starting out."</p>
            
            <h5 class="text-primary my-4">The Transformation</h5>
            
            <p>Within 18 months of joining EduCoach, David was earning more from his online courses than from his full-time job. "The platform's revenue-sharing model is incredibly fair, and the built-in marketing tools helped me reach students I never would have found on my own."</p>
            
            <p>David's "Zero to Full-Stack" course has now helped more than 500 students transition into tech careers. "The most rewarding part is getting messages from former students about their new jobs and projects. One student went from working retail to landing a $95,000 developer job after completing my course and building a portfolio."</p>
            
            <p>Today, David has expanded his EduCoach offerings to include personalized mentorship programs and career coaching. "I've built a community around my courses where students help each other, collaborate on projects, and network for job opportunities."</p>
            
            <h5 class="text-primary my-4">David's Advice for New Coaches</h5>
            
            <p>"Start by teaching what you know best and what you're genuinely passionate about," David advises. "Use EduCoach's analytics to understand which parts of your courses resonate most with students, then double down on those strengths."</p>
            
            <p>He also emphasizes the importance of continuous learning. "I spend at least 10 hours a week keeping my skills and courses updated. Technology changes fast, and your teaching must keep pace. EduCoach makes updating content simple, which is essential in my field."</p>
            
            <p>For David, the freedom to teach on his own terms has been life-changing. "I work fewer hours than I did in tech, yet I reach thousands of students and make a bigger impact. Plus, I can teach from anywhereâ€”last year I taught while traveling through Southeast Asia for three months."</p>
