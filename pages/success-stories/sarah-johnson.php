            <h5 class="text-primary mb-3">From Struggling Teacher to Online Education Entrepreneur</h5>
            
            <p>Five years ago, Sarah Johnson was a high school math teacher struggling to make ends meet. Passionate about education but frustrated by the limitations of traditional teaching methods, Sarah decided to explore online tutoring as a side hustle.</p>
            
            <p>When she joined EduCoach, everything changed. Sarah shares, "EduCoach gave me the platform and tools to teach in a way that truly engages students. I could create interactive lessons, track student progress, and provide personalized feedback—all while reaching a global audience."</p>
            
            <p>Within her first year on EduCoach, Sarah was able to quit her teaching job and focus full-time on her online coaching business. She developed comprehensive courses in algebra, calculus, and SAT/ACT test preparation that quickly gained popularity for their clarity and effectiveness.</p>
            
            <h5 class="text-primary my-4">The Transformation</h5>
            
            <p>"The flexibility of working from anywhere has been life-changing," Sarah explains. "I've been able to travel while teaching, reaching students from over 30 countries. More importantly, I'm earning three times what I made as a classroom teacher while helping more students than ever before."</p>
            
            <p>Sarah's students have reported remarkable improvements in their grades and test scores. One of her students, Jamal, increased his SAT math score by 200 points after completing her 8-week course. Another student, Maya, went from failing math to receiving a scholarship for engineering studies.</p>
            
            <p>Today, Sarah manages a team of five assistant tutors on EduCoach, scaling her impact while maintaining the quality of instruction that made her successful.</p>
            
            <h5 class="text-primary my-4">Sarah's Advice for New Coaches</h5>
            
            <p>"Don't try to be everything to everyone," Sarah advises. "Find your specific niche and focus on delivering exceptional value in that area. Be patient with your growth, consistently gather and implement student feedback, and use EduCoach's analytics to refine your teaching methods."</p>
            
            <p>Sarah credits EduCoach's supportive community and robust features for her success. "The platform handles all the technical aspects—payments, scheduling, content hosting—allowing me to focus solely on teaching. The marketing tools and SEO optimization helped me get discovered by students who needed exactly what I offer."</p>
